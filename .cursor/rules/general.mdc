## Code Style and Structure
- Write concise, readable TypeScript code
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Implement early returns for better readability

## Naming Conventions
- Use lowercase with dashes (kebab-case) for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard) and files (e.g. my-component.tsx)
- Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (isLoading, hasError)
- Favor named exports.

## TypeScript Usage
- Use TypeScript for all code
- Prefer interfaces over types
- Avoid enums; use const maps instead
- Implement proper type safety and inference

## Syntax and Formatting
- Use the "function" keyword for pure functions
- Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditionals; use concise syntax for simple statements

## Other
- Try to limit installing new packages whenever it makes sense to add code directly to the project. Less dependencies are good for performance
