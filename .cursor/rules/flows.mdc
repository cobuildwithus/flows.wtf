# Flows.wtf Platform Overview

## Core Concept
Flows is a decentralized grant program that provides continuous funding to builders through streaming payments. The platform enables real-time compensation for work, with funds being streamed every second to grant recipients.

## Key Components

### Grants
- Grants are organized into categories called "flows"
- Each flow has specific rules, guidelines, and requirements
- Recipients receive continuous streaming payments based on their performance
- Grants can be voted on by community members, affecting the streaming rate
- Maximum of 2 active grants per user

### Application Process
- Builders apply through structured templates specific to each flow
- Applications require:
  - Title
  - Description (following flow-specific template)
  - Image
  - Optional tagline
- Applications are publicly visible and can be discussed by the community

### Monitoring & Evaluation
- Grant recipients are expected to share regular updates on Farcaster
- Progress is tracked through:
  - Stories (documented by Dr Gonzo)
  - Social media engagement
  - Community feedback
  - Impact metrics
- Grant grades and streaming rates adjust based on performance

### Community Integration
- Deep integration with Farcaster for social engagement
- Community voting system affects grant funding
- Public discourse and feedback loops
- Focus on nounish values:
  - Do good with no expectation of return
  - Create positive externalities
  - Embrace absurdity & difference
  - Teach people about nouns & crypto
  - Have fun

### Technical Infrastructure
- Built on blockchain technology for transparent fund distribution
- Integrated with Farcaster for social engagement
- Automated evaluation systems
- AI-powered assistance and documentation
